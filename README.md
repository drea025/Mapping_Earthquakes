# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Overview
In this project we are using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coodrinates. This will reveal the magnitudes of the earthquakes for the last seven days in order to create a visual the shows the differences between the magnituded od the earthquakes. 

We used JavaScriot and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes. We also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox through an API request to create interactivtity for the earthquake data.
